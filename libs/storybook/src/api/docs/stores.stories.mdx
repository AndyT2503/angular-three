# Stores

NGT makes use of an internal Store called `NgtStore`. This is the combination of [@rx-angular/state](https://github.com/rx-angular/rx-angular) and [@ngrx/component-store](https://ngrx.io).

## `NgtCanvasStore`

This store is the main store for the Canvas. It is responsible for keeping the Renderer, Scene, Camera, and other states/configurations for the 3 main building blocks. It also contains information about the Viewport like Size and Device Pixel Ratio (DPR).

## `NgtAnimationFrameStore`

This store keeps track of all the animation callbacks that are registered. Animations are registered via two ways:

-   `(animateReady)` Output
-   `NgtAnimationFrameStore#register`

The difference between the two is that the former subscribes a single object to the Animation Frame.

```html
<ngt-mesh (animateReady)="onThisMeshAnimate()"></ngt-mesh>
<ngt-mesh (animateReady)="onThatMeshAnimate()"></ngt-mesh>
```

Some time, it works well. But when you need to orchestrate both meshes through each frame, you cannot use `(animateReady)`. Instead, you can inject `NgtAnimationFrameStore` and call the `register()` method.

```ts
@Component({
    selector: 'two-meshes',
    template: `
        <ngt-mesh #meshOne></ngt-mesh>
        <ngt-mesh #meshTwo></ngt-mesh>
    `,
})
export class TwoMeshesComponent {
    @ViewChild('meshOne') meshOne: NgtMesh;
    @ViewChild('meshTwo') meshTwo: NgtMesh;

    private animationUuid?: string;

    constructor(private animationFrameStore: NgtAnimationFrameStore) {}

    ngOnInit() {
        this.animationUuid = this.animationFrameStore.register({
            callback: () => {
                this.meshOne.mesh.rotation.y += 0.01;
                this.meshTwo.mesh.rotation.y += 0.01;
            },
        });
    }

    ngOnDestroy() {
        this.animationFrameStore.unregister(this.animationUuid);
    }
}
```

`NgtAnimationFrameStore#register` returns a `string` UUID which we can use to `unregister` the animation callback.

## `NgtEventsStore`

This store handles the Events inside the Canvas with `Raycaster` and `Intersection` objects. This store is internal, but it is exposed to the consumers. We should never have a need to use this store directly.
