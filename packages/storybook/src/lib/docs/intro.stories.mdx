## What is Angular Three (NGT)?

**Angular Three** is a **Component Library** that wraps around [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) to provide a declarative approach to building 3D applications using [Angular](https://angular.io/) capabilities.

> Both Angular and THREE.js skills are required to use NGT. Fundamental understanding of both will help you to understand the concepts and the implementation of NGT.

## Why is it good to use NGT?

Utilizing Template-less Directives to build 3D scenes declaratively with accessing to Angular Dependency Injection, Inputs, Outputs, and other common Directives while keeping the DOM clean.

## How does NGT work?

NGT relies heavily on [Hierarchical Dependency Injection](https://angular.io/guide/hierarchical-dependency-injection) to allow for declarative creation of THREE.js objects on the template. Take a look at the [SimpleCube example](?path=/story/introduction-examples--simple-cube).

Now that you've seen the `SimpleCube` in action, let's examine its code:

```html
<ngt-canvas>
  <ngt-mesh
    #mesh="ngtMesh"
    (animateReady)="
        mesh.mesh.rotation.x = mesh.mesh.rotation.x + 0.01;
        mesh.mesh.rotation.y = mesh.mesh.rotation.y + 0.01
      "
  >
    <ngt-mesh-basic-material
      [parameters]="{ color: 'turquoise' }"
    ></ngt-mesh-basic-material>
    <ngt-box-geometry></ngt-box-geometry>
  </ngt-mesh>
</ngt-canvas>
```

> Due to Storybook limitation, the `(animateReady)` is handled inline, but you should make a method (eg: `onAnimateReady(mesh.mesh)`) to handle this Output
